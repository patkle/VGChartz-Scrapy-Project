# VGChartz

This project is configured to be hosted on [Scrapy Cloud](https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/).  

It uses [Zyte Smart Proxy Manager](https://scrapinghub.com/?rfsn=4170080.0597ad) as proxy service.  

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patkle/video-game-sales-data-from-vgchartzcom).  
A Jupyter Notebook with some EDA on that data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/patkle/video-game-sales-data-playground-for-vgchartz-data/edit).

## Game Statistics

The spider can be ran with
```zsh
python3 -m scrapy crawl game_statistics -a pages=5 -O game_statistics.csv
```

### Arguments

With `-a` you can specify arguments for the spider.  

|argument   |type  |description   | 
|---|---|---|
|pages   |int   |number of pages to scrape   |
